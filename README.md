# Tz-Brute
Tezos password bruteforcer built on top of Arthur Breitman's fundraiser tools for validation.  
  
## How to use:  
##### Mac OS
###### Just run ```run-osx.sh``` or follow the steps below:

Firstly you'll need to install Python 3 if you don't have it already.  
pyenv is a great way to manage multiple python installations, if you want to use pyenv open up a Terminal and run:  
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
pyenv install 3.6.5
pyenv global 3.6.5
```  
If you don't want to use pyenv you can download Python 3 here:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  
Next step is installing pip:
```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```  
  
Now we have pip we need to download and unzip this file:  
https://github.com/NODESPLIT/tz-brute/archive/master.zip  
You can then type "cd " into terminal (without brackets and with the space at the end) then drag and drop the newly unzipped folder into the terminal window and run the resulting command.  
  
We now need to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From here we can run Tz-Brute like so:
```bash
python main.py
```
  
##### Linux
###### Just run ```run-linux.sh```
  
##### Windows

## Parameters:
##### Charset (1 - 6):
This is basically the characters that could be in your password, the lower the number and the less in the charset the better as it'll mean less permutations to test.
```
1| "0123456789"
2| "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
3| "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
4| "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
5| "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"
6| "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"
```
##### Minimum (1 - ?):
This is the password length that the bruteforcer will start at, this can really help cut down on crack time by skipping the multitudes of permutations possible in lengths that you don't think your password would be.

##### Public key (e.g. tz1ABCDeF...):
This is the address you were given as your Tezos address upon contribution.

##### Email address:
This is the email address you used when you contributed. This is CASE SENSITIVE.

##### Mnemonic (e.g. apples cat radio...):
This is the mnemonic you received upon contribution, it will be within the PDF you downloaded. It's a long string of words all in lowercase separated by spaces.

## Reset:
Without resetting the script will start from where it last left off.  
You can reset your anchor.json by running:
```bash
python main.py reset
```
This will backup your anchor.json with a timestamp, remember to delete these when you're done as they will have your contribution details in them.
